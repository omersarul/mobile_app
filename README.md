# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer App

This project is a mobile application that utilizes **Deep Neural Networks** to transfer the artistic style of one image onto another. It features a modern **Flutter** frontend for user interaction and a **Python** backend that powers the machine learning algorithms for style transfer.

*In the example above, a portrait photo is reimagined using the style of Van Gogh's "The Starry Night".*

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Style Transfer:** Transforms ordinary photos into artistic masterpieces using advanced machine learning algorithms.
* **Mobile Interface:** A smooth and intuitive user experience built with **Flutter**.
* **Deep Learning:** Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to separate and recombine content and style features.
* **Backend Integration:** Seamless communication between the mobile app and the Python-based ML model.
